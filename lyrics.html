        <h2>The Parody Master Title</h2>
        
        <p>Newcomers to chess often hold the mistaken belief that Grandmaster is the most sought-after title in the game. While it is indeed a remarkable and worthy achievement, and a celebration of the combination of talent and years of hard work, there are thousands of grandmasters these days. Indeed, it is said that one cannot throw a rook in the streets of Chennai without hitting a GM. Much rarer (and less widely-known) is the Parody Master title, which requires three norms earned by the release of critically-acclaimed original chess-themed parodies.</p>
        
        <p>The vastly experienced former prodigy WIM Anna-Maja Kazarian is perhaps the closest to becoming the next recipient of this highest honour. This should come as no surprise, as, having both sung and competed in chess from a very young age, she is ideally placed to chase this title.</p>
        
        <p>Her first PM norm came in February 2023, when she recorded the popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1wtjgc5rzU" target="_blank">Hate To See Ya</a>, a parody of Niall Horan's "Nice To Meet Ya" that addressed the crippling server issues chess.com was facing at the time. Not only did the tune entertain thousands, but chess.com quickly resolved their problems, showcasing the great power Anna-Maja wields with her voice.</p>
          
        <p>After a bit of a break to focus on her OTB exploits, Anna-Maja returned to the recording studio in September 2025, where she produced <a href="https://skrewz07.github.io/phoebeatles/#whitehorseysite" target="_blank">White Horsey Site</a>. This chess-themed reimagining of Chappell Roan's blockbuster "Pink Pony Club" was a powerful ballad depicting the inner struggles of a chess streamer who is contractually bound to stream on chess.com, but whose heart yearns for <a href="https://lichess.org" target="_blank">lichess.org</a>. Once again, Anna-Maja's singing had immediate effect, as chess.com made Arena Kings a monthly, rather than weekly, event.</p>

        <p>This leaves Anna-Maja one parody short of the title, and to help her get over the line, her musical seconds have prepared the lyrics below, for her to record if/whenever she feels like. As is perhaps fitting for this milestone melody, this song shifts the focus to Anna-Maja herself, and extols the virtues of her signature move. Enjoy!</p>

          <h4>Playin' g5</h4>
          <h5>by <span class="highlight">Aye Ems</span></h5>
          <p>A parody of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNFzfwLM72c" target="_blank">"Stayin' Alive"</a> by Bee Gees.</p>
          <p>An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3UKX6zsmL4" target="_blank">instrumental version</a> of the song to sing along to.</p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <p>Well, you can tell by the way I push my pawns,<br/>
          It's exciting, no time for yawns,<br/>
          The tactics sharp and the clock runs low,<br/>
          I'm seizin' space with each tempo.</p>

          <p>And now I control the kingside,<br/>
          And you may say I've been inspired,<br/>
          The wisest words we ever wrote,<br/>
          Oh, Philidor's most famous quote.</p>

          <p class="chorus">Whether you're a boomer or whether you're a zoomer,<br/>
          I'm playin' g5, playin' g5,<br/>
          Got my pawn advancin' and I could begin dancin',<br/>
          When I'm playin' g5, playin' g5,<br/>
          Ah, ah, ah, ah,<br/>
          Playin' g5, playin' g5,<br/>
          Ah, ah, ah, ah,<br/>
          Playin' g fiiiiiiiiiiiive,<br/>
          Oh, watch me push.</p>

          <p>Well now, I play Black and I play White,<br/>
          And I'll claim g5 from either side,<br/>
          It's the perfect outpost, a great square,<br/>
          It's my dream come true and your nightmare.</p>

          <p>And now I control the kingside,<br/>
          It's amazing how fast pawns glide,<br/>
          The wisest words we ever wrote,<br/>
          Oh, Philidor's most famous quote.</p>

          <p class="chorus">Whether you're a boomer or whether you're a zoomer,<br/>
